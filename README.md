# maze-solver

## Brief discription:

Building a software UI that finds the optimal path from a starting point to an endpoint using the following pathfinding algorithms:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
3. **Uniform-Cost Search (UCF)**
4. **Best-First Search (Greedy Search)**
5. ***A* Search***

By comparing these algorithms, we can determine which one performs best for specific paths. The UI allows users to freely choose both the starting and ending points before running all algorithms.

## Requirements:

- UI interface.
- All searching algorithms.
- Writing all details for each of search algorithm.
